# CODSOFT
This is a personal portfolio website I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was made as part of Task 1 for the CODSOFT Full Stack Web Development track.

About the Project:
The main goal of this project is to showcase:
My skills
Projects I’ve worked on
My resume and achievements
A simple Contact Me section
Everything is built using only front-end technologies – no backend or database.

What I Used:
HTML for the structure of the website
CSS for design and layout
JavaScript for making the site interactive
